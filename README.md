# Portfolio Website Conversion to Next.js

This project is a transformation of a portfolio website originally crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a modern Next.js application. I'm Balikis Omotunrayo Omolewa, and this project marks a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. It’s that pivotal moment when you recognize the need to upskill and embrace more advanced technologies in the field. Five months ago, I built this portfolio with the fundamental tools of web development, and now, it’s time to take it to the next level.

## Project Overview

Five months ago, I created this portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It served its purpose, but as I grew more knowledgeable and the web development landscape evolved, I realized the potential of newer technologies like Next.js. This project represents my transition into using these advanced tools, aiming to improve both the performance and the scalability of the site.

### Key Features

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Ensures faster load times and enhances SEO by rendering pages on the server.
- Static Site Generation (SSG): Generates static pages at build time for maximum performance.
- Modular Component Design: The site is now broken down into reusable React components, making it more maintainable and scalable.
- Modern Styling: CSS Modules are used for scoped, maintainable styles.

### Technologies Used

- Next.js: For server-side rendering and static site generation.
- React: To build reusable and interactive UI components.
- CSS Modules: To maintain clean and scoped styles.
- JavaScript (ES6+)**: The driving force behind dynamic functionality.
- HTML/CSS: The foundation that has been enhanced with modern tools.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Learning Curve with Next.js
   Transitioning from a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript setup to a more complex Next.js environment came with its challenges. Understanding server-side rendering, static site generation, and how to structure a Next.js application required a steep learning curve.

### 2. Componentization of Existing Code
   Breaking down the existing site into reusable React components was both rewarding and challenging. It required rethinking how the site was structured and ensuring that each component was modular and maintainable.

### 3. State Management
   Managing state in a React-based application, particularly when converting from a traditional JavaScript setup, posed some difficulties. Understanding how to manage and pass state between components was a critical aspect of this conversion.

### 4. Styling with CSS Modules
   Converting global CSS styles into scoped CSS Modules required careful planning. Ensuring that styles remained consistent while taking advantage of CSS Modules' benefits was a delicate balancing act.

### 5. Optimization for Performance
   While Next.js inherently offers performance benefits, making the best use of these features required careful optimization. Lazy loading images, optimizing build sizes, and ensuring fast page loads were some of the key focus areas.
